// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Createoneplayerarrayforeachteam(variables'players1'and 'players2')
// 2. Thefirstplayerinanyplayerarrayisthegoalkeeperandtheothersarefield players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
// 3. Createanarray'allPlayers'containingallplayersofbothteams(22 players)
// 4. Duringthegame,BayernMunich(team1)used3substituteplayers.Socreatea new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
// 5. Basedonthegame.oddsobject,createonevariableforeachodd(called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
// 6. Writeafunction('printGoals')thatreceivesanarbitrarynumberofplayer names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
// 7. Theteamwiththeloweroddismorelikelytowin.Printtotheconsolewhich team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.
